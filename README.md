# BOOTSTRAPIFY

A *paid* [Shopify Theme](http://themes.shopify.com/) powered by [Twitter Bootstrap v2.0](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

## STATUS

**01 Feb 2012** - *Under development* 

	- Aiming to release within the next 10 days (10 Feb 2012).
	- Plan sell in the [Shopify Theme Store](http://themes.shopify.com/) - at [their minimum](http://themes.shopify.com/services/themes/guidelines/) **paid** price point of $80.
	- Expect to launch with 1 preset theme and release 3 more variations (which are included in the purchase) within 30 days following the initial release (1 new variation every 10 days: 20 February, 1 March, 11 March).
	- I will fully support the theme and contribute any bug fixes back into the Twitter Bootstrap project.
	- This project will be kept open source (even though it's a paid theme). I trust people will be honest and pay for the theme if they use it as a foundation for their store ... think - if you charge $40/hr and this code saves you >2hrs work (and trust me it will!) then bill your client, and flick me the $80 to continue maintaining & supporting this theme.
	- I will keep this theme up-to-date with all future Twitter Bootstrap releases.
